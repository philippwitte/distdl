class MPIExpandableBuffer(ABC):
    r"""NumPy (mpi4py compatible) implementation of expandable buffers.

    For use as intermediate communication buffers, as is common in MPI-based
    applications.

    An expandable buffer stores a linear (1D) array, from which contiguous
    blocks can be viewed with arbitrary shape.  This way, buffers can be
    re-used by multiple layers, for memory efficiency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : cupy.dtype
        The data type of the buffer
    initial_capacity : integer, optional
        The initial capacity of the raw buffer

    Attributes
    ----------
    dtype : cupy.dtype
        The data type of the buffer
    capacity : integer, optional
        The capacity of the raw buffer
    raw_buffer : cupy.ndarray
        The underlying 1D storage buffer
    views : dict
        Dictionary mapping shapes to contiguous numpy array views

        buffer is reallocated, the old buffer is copied in, and all current
        views are mapped to the new buffer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        new_capacity : int
            Proposed new capacity of the buffer.
